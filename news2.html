<p>THE LAB - Following the one dollar price increase of the kelburn cafes noodle salads. The Victoria University of Wellington has seen a significant rise in the number of students seeking more money through course related costs. To determine if this was related to the price increase of food on campus we sent a reporter to interview some students that were personally affected by this price raise. 

<br /> <br />
When questioned about her thoughts on the LAB's price increase the Victoria student Florence, 20, reported that she now had to buy her food outside from a vegan food container as she didn't have the extra one dollar to splurge at The LAB. "I wish that I could still afford The LAB food as I loved every aspect of my daily lunch routine. Sadly due to the price increase I now have to buy food from Krishna Foods and the white paper plate doesn't send off a prosperous vibe like the LAB cardboard boxes do." 
<br /> <br />

Another student that wished to remain anonymous said that he did indeed seek more money via course related costs to keep on buying food and get his daily caffeine fix from The LAB. When questioned why, he just replied "Because I'm loyal" supposedly quoting his favorite Love Island star.
